<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>PK</h3>
<p>An alien lands on earth but loses his remote to go home. Does 'PK' return - and as he navigates the human world, what does he gain and lose?</p>

<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>Every child is special. Really touched my bottom of heart . I have watched this movie several times.</p>

<h3>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</h3>
<p>Dilwale made me glad to be a Westerner, just so I could experience the sheer rush in the glorious way this film simply throws its Indian sensibility in your face. It is one of the most completely, openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film, it is yet completely un-Western, and absolutely invigorating.</p>
